All data regarding Economist is stored on its local database which is only directly accessible by \`${client.users.cache.get(client.config.owner).tag}\`, who is the bot owner. 
However, there are certain users that are able to access, edit and delete your data. In the ${linkToSupportServer}, users who have the Database Manager role can use the \`${message.guild.prefix}set\`, \`${message.guild.prefix}get\` and \`${message.guild.prefix}delete\` commands on users. 

Additionally, **__repl.it__** support staff also have access to the database as a result of data persistence issues; it is worth noting that they are not likely to waste time digging through data stored on it.

By your continued use of Economist, we will assume that you agree to the Collection and manipulation of user data (IDs)

**In regards to User Data**, only specific user IDs are stored. Other details, such as the user's tag, avatar URL and creation date are fetched directly from Discord itself and are not stored; only displayed.

Messages, users and \`GuildMembers\` will all remain cached until next restart, at which point that are fetched from Discord once again and transferred into the cache.

Intents: \`['GUILD_MEMBERS', 'GUILD_MESSAGES', 'GUILDS']\`
