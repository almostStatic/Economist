You can also purchase "custom roles". These roles will be created and held within our [support server](${client.config.ssInvite}), each user is able to own an unlimited amount of roles; each role will have its own "keyword" which the bot will use in order to recognise the role you wish to use. As a result of this, only one keyword can be linked to a single role instantaneously. 

**1x Custom Role** - £10
